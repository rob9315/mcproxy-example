# mcproxy-example

an example on how to use [mcproxy](https://github.com/rob9315/mcproxy)

## is this still being developed

this example will not be developed anymore, that is why it is archived. You are free to clone and modify it to your hearts content though.
It is only meant to give an example on how to use it, though it has some flaws, as in with too many connections it crashes and/or gets overloaded.
